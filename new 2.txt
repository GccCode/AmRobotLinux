After using it for a while, comparing the price, this effect exceeded expectations.

This sterilizer is ozone generated by internal devices and then diffused through the CPAP hose into the interior of the CPAP machine or mask. It kills bacteria on a larger scale than soapy water because ozone can enter smaller gaps and corners. As described in the product, it is able to kill bacteria in all directions.
Compared with the more than 300 US dollars of equipment, the core function is no different, but the user can directly put the mask to be disinfected directly into the expensive equipment. With this sterilizer, I need to remove the hose and mask and connect it to the sterilizer, and in order to improve the disinfection effect, I used a plastic bag to seal the hose and the mask.
Overall, this sterilizer is more economical and has the same length as an iPhone, making it easy to store and carry.
